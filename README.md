# to-do-list

Little review on what is here. You asked to make some project and i try to make max simple to do list. As i only on the second week start to understand what i'm writing, i code as slowly as turtle.
So i build something look like interface there. It is not adaptive and some things don't work but i'm in process of finding reasons why.
And inteface now is a little bit strange but i'm in process of modifing. Some things where rewritten so also in process of checking them.
